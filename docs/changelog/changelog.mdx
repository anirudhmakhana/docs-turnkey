# Releases

See here for release notes by date.

## 2024-09-18

### Additional support for Bitcoin, Sui, and Aptos
- We now support address derivations for BTC, Sui, and Aptos.
- We've also implemented Schnorr signing to further support Bitcoin transactions.

### Add support for parsing Solana transactions
Legacy Solana transactions and Solana Versioned Transactions can now be parsed by Turnkey's Solana parser, as part of our Solana policy engine. 

## 2024-09-01

### Makes email optional for `ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_READ_WRITE_SESSION`
This version of `ACTIVITY_TYPE_CREATE_READ_WRITE_SESSION` allows users to pass in an optional userId. An email will no longer be required for this activity type.

## 2024-08-21

### Introduces support for OAuth (OIDC 2.0)
Our [OAuth](https://docs.turnkey.com/features/oauth) feature is now live and out of beta. This introduces the following functionalities:

- Sign in and authentication via popular providers such as Google, Apple, and Facebook (via OpenID Connect tokens) for organizations and sub-organizations
- Custom OAuth configurations for your organizations or sub-organizations

All OIDC tokens are verified via Turnkey's secure enclaves, with a newly designed enclave to [fetch TLS content](https://quorum.tkhq.xyz/posts/tls-sessions-within-tees).

## 2024-08-15

### Add new activity type for deleting private keys and wallets
You can now delete private keys and wallets from your organization.

## 2024-08-12

### Release Turnkey wallet stamper
The [`@turnkey/wallet-stamper`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/wallet-stamper) package provides a mechanism to stamp requests using a wallet public key and signature. This package supports both Solana and Ethereum wallets. A demo of how this works can be found [here](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/packages/wallet-stamper).

## 2024-08-05

### Finalize OAuth integration to use TLS fetcher enclave

With our OAuth implementation almost complete, customers will be able to securely authenticate end users with social logins like Twitter, Google, Facebook, and more. This release ensures that TLS content can be fetched from our secure enclaves using a specialized enclave called the TLS fetcher.

### Introduces support for Ed25519 API keys

Our API now has support for the Ed25519 cryptographic curve! This improves Ed25519 compatibility in two ways:

- You can now create an API key for an existing user by using `API_KEY_CURVE_ED25519` for the `curveType` parameter. This will give users and suborganizations within your Turnkey implementation additional authenticators for transaction signing.
- You can also stamp a request using the `SIGNATURE_SCHEME_TK_API_ED25519` for the `scheme` parameter in the stamp, along with an Ed25519 signature of the json body. You will need to add a public key using the endpoint determined by creating an API key.

Stay tuned for our Ed25519 SDK! Chains on the Ed25519 cryptographic curve include Solana, TON, Polkadot, Stellar, Cardano, and Tezos.
