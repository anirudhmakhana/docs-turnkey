# Integration with other ecosystems

## Cosmos

We support address derivation and have published a package on NPM to help with transaction construction: [`@turnkey/cosmjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/cosmjs). See it in action in [`examples/with-cosmjs`](https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-cosmjs)

## Tron, Sui, Aptos

We support address derivation for these ecosystems.

## What about others?

Turnkey supports bare ed25519 and secp256k1 signing which covers most ecosystems and blockchains out there. If your ecosytem of choice isn't covered adequately we're open to feedback. Give us a shout on [X](https://x.com/turnkeyhq/) or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clubturnkey/shared_invite/zt-2837d2isy-gbH60kJ~XnXSSFHiqVOrqw)!
