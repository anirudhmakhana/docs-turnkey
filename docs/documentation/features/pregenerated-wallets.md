# Pre-generated wallets

Turnkey allows you to pre-generate wallets for your user before they authenticate. This is helpful if you already know the users email, and want to create a deposit address for them or airdrop a reward before they authenticate to Turnkey.

To accomplish this, create a new sub-org for that user with a single root user. This root user should only have the end userâ€™s email associated with it, and no other authenticators, which ensures that only the end user can claim the pre-generated wallet. When the end user wants to claim the wallet, they can complete [email authentication](https://docs.turnkey.com/features/email-auth) or [email recovery](https://docs.turnkey.com/features/email-recovery) to authenticate to the wallet and sign a transaction or add a new authenticator.
